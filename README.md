- 👋 Hi, I’m @LivelySins
- 👀 I’m interested in everything (to varying levels), so feel free to ask me about anything! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science on Codecademy, which means hand-on work with SQL and Python. Also learning about the theory behind data science, which is fascinating
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, if you can handle an almost complete rookie. I can (try to) do code reviews as well
- 📫 How to reach me ...
